# **Week 1 Project: Predicting Solar Power Output using Linear Regression**

## **Project Overview**
This project involves predicting solar power output using a linear regression model. It utilizes a dataset containing features like temperature, humidity, and solar irradiance to estimate the generated solar power (in kW).  
The goal is to preprocess the data, train a regression model, evaluate its performance, and visualize the results.

---

## **Project Objectives**
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data for analysis.  
- **Model Training**: Use a linear regression model to predict solar power output.  
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.  
- **Visualization**: Create plots to visualize the relationship between actual and predicted values.  

---

## **Key Features**
1. Preprocessing missing or inconsistent data values.
2. Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Training a linear regression model using scikit-learn.
4. Evaluating the model with MSE and R² metrics.
5. Visualizing actual vs. predicted values using Matplotlib.
